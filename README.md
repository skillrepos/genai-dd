# Generative AI for Developers - Deep Dive

Repository for Generative AI hands-on workshop

These instructions will guide you through configuring a GitHub Codespaces environment that you can use to run the course labs. 

**1. Click on the button below to start a new codespace from this repository.

Click here ➡️  [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/skillrepos/genai-dd?quickstart=1)

**2. Then click on the option to create a new codespace.**

This will run for several minutes while it gets everything ready.


The codespace is ready to use when you see a prompt like the one shown below in its terminal.

**3. Open up the *labs.md* file so you can follow along with the labs.**
You can either open it in a separate browser instance or open it in the codespace. If you open it in the codespace, make sure to *Open Preview* so you can see it in Markdown form as intended.

**Now, you are ready for the labs!**

**4. (Optional, but recommended) Change your codespace's default timeout from 30 minutes to longer (60 for half-day sessions, 90 for deep dive sessions).**
To do this, when logged in to GitHub, go to https://github.com/settings/codespaces and scroll down on that page until you see the *Default idle timeout* section. Adjust the value as desired.

**NOTE: If your codespace times out and you need to reopen it**

1. Go to https://github.com/<your github userid>/codespaces
2. Find the codespace in the list, right-click, and select *Open in browser*
